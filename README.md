# About
[**Final Presentation**](https://www.figma.com/proto/FQBEy3bloUIJs9qN8vAxy5/MoLab?page-id=109%3A157&type=design&node-id=109-158&viewport=515%2C429%2C0.05&t=mhuJgjiGdKGh4NEF-1&scaling=contain&mode=design)

Druze is a collage making app where users can upload images from their camera roll, add text labels, add shapes, and draw onto a free-form canvas. Users can have multiple "Blooms" (collages) that are all stored to their device using json files. The app is maybe 40% complete right now with many quality-of-life features lacking and several key features that have yet to be implemented.

This app was created over 3 weeks as the final project for my Fall 2023 Mobile App Development Class at NYU IMA led by John Henry Thompson. 

# Inspiration
My original plan for this project was to make a collaborative canvas. I imagined something similar to [Landing](https://landing.space/), [Pinterest Shuffles](https://www.shffls.com/), or [ID by Amo](https://x.com/amoamoamo/status/1726212349151871095?s=20). My hopes were quickly dashed away when I realized how difficult it would be to build just a single-player canvas. I shifted my focus around creating a solid single-player collage creation system. 

# Completed Features
- Upload images from camera roll
- Add text labels from inputted text
- Add shapes from SF Symbols
- Draw on canvas (50%)
- Reposition, rotate, reorder, and recolor elements
- Change canvas background image
- Have multiple canvases
- Everything saved in .json

# WIP Features
- Drawings do not save
- Save / export canvases
- Multi-user experience
- Integrate with GIPHY API
- Ability to rename canvases
- Default options for canvas backgrounds
- Undo / redo
- Bunch of different QoL changes (delete canvases from home screen, user profiles, movement is janky, loading is slow...)

# Future Plans
Going forward, I think the most important feature will be to implement sharing of Blooms. How else will your friends find out about the app? Big picture, I imagine creating a sort of social media app where users create an account and can share their Blooms onto a feed and collaborate with other users (but that's a long way off).
